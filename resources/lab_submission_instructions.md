Student Assignment Submission Instructions
------

1. Rename notebook with your __login id appended to beginning__: `1_assignment_regression.ipynb` -> `bspiering_1_assignment_regression.ipynb`.
2. Delete
    ```python
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    raise NotImplementedError()
    ```
1. Write code until unit tests pass (or you give up).
1. Upload notebook on Canvas before due date and time.

Here are __invalid__ renaming examples:

- `Brian_Spiering_1_assignment_regression.ipynb`
- `Brian_Spiering.ipynb`
- `bspiering.ipynb`

If the file was not renamed in the right format, it would be regarded as no submission and graded as zero.

Do __not__ import anything, unless explicitly instructed. No additional imports from Python's Standard Library and no third-party packages.

There are __no__ hidden tests, unless explicitly stated. Thus, you code does __not__ need to work on all valid and invalid inputs. Your code needs to work on the inputs in the visible tests.

Do __not__ add extra cells. Adding any additional cells will result in a zero grade.

Late assignments will only be accepted for medical emergencies.

You might have the phenomena of "it works on my computer" but still lose points. Even though your code passed all the tests on your computer, your code could still be incorrect. 

There is a common logical fallacy with testing code: A failing test means there is guaranteed to be a problem. A passing test does not guarantee there is no problem.

I do my best to create a test suit, but tests are no guarantee of complete correctness. Remember - it is impossible to fully test a program. Read more about that concept [here](http://www.testingeducation.org/BBST/foundations/Kaner_impossibility.pdf).

The test are there to assist you and me, not replace thinking for you or me.
