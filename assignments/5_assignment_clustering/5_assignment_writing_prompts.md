Since the dimensions are latitude and longitude, visualize the clusters to answer the following questions. The visualization is not a deliverable.

1) (2 points) Write a 1-2 sentence summary of what you found about San Francisco Police Department Incidents.

2) (1 point) Some clusters are denser (i.e., the isocontour, the equal probability ellipse, is smaller). What does that tell you about those clusters?

3) (1 point) Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) allow each cluster to have different variances and covariances. Why is that useful property in this context?

4) (1 point) Why is soft clustering a useful type of clustering in this context?
